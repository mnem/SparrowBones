SparrowBones
============

Simple UIViewController based alternative to the Sparrow-Framework's app
scaffold. Created primarily because I wanted the OS to do the view rotation
for me because I never hold the phone the right way round for games...

Because it's UIViewController based, it plays a little more nicely with
some service plugins such as the Testflight SDK, and anything else that
expects to find a valid RootViewController.
