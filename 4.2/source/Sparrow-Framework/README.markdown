Sparrow Framework: The Open Source Game Engine for iOS
======================================================

What is Sparrow?
----------------
 
Sparrow is a pure Objective C library targeted on making game development as easy and hassle-free
as possible. Sparrow makes it possible to write fast OpenGL applications without having to touch
OpenGL or pure C (but easily allowing to do so, for those who wish). It uses a tried and tested
API that is easy to use and hard to misuse.
 
Who is Sparrow for?
-------------------
 
Obviously, Sparrow is for iPhone and iPad developers, especially those involved in game development.
You will need to have a basic understanding of Objective-C – but there’s no way around that on the
iOS anyway.

If you have already worked with Adobe™ Flash/Flex technology, you will immediately befriend with
Sparrow since it uses lots of similar concepts and naming schemes. That said, everything is
designed to be as intuitive as possible, so any Java™ or .Net™ developer will get the hang of it
quickly as well.
