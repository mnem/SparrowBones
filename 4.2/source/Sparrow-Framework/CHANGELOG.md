Sparrow: Changelog
==================

version 1.2 - 2011-05-22
------------------------

- added pivotX- and pivotY-property to SPDisplayObject to allow manipulation of the origin point
- added support for GZip'ed PVR textures
- added support for texture frames aka trimmed textures
- added kerning to bitmap fonts (if the font file contains kerning information)
- added [SPStage mainStage] method for quick access to the stage
- added ability to choose between nearest neighbor, bilinear and trilinear texture filtering
- added 'moveToX:y' and 'scaleTo:' methods to SPTween
- added support for RGBA8888 texture format
- added support for tweening unsigned integers
- added events on each loop of an SPMovieClip
- added support for directories when loading resource files; in iOS 3.x, that did not work before.
- added color property to stage
- added [NSBundle appBundle] extension method. This method is now used throughout the framework 
  instead of [NSBundle mainBundle]. That way, unit tests will find their resource files, too.
- updated button to behave just like a textfield: the text does not stretch any longer
  when width or height are changed
- updated projects for Xcode4
- updated xml parsing to work around memory leak
- fixed bounds-optimization of SPQuad, which might have failed in subclasses
- fixed path handling of bitmap font and atlas classes
- fixed that HD textures were only found within application bundle
- fixed texture binding problems of SPRenderTexture
- fixed generate_atlas.rb script to work with Ruby 1.9
- fixed looping behavior of tween and movie clip
- fixed wrong scale setting when loading bitmap font with custom texture
- fixed bug that caused Sparrow to treat new touch as if it was an existing one
- fixed name of random number method because of conflicting keyword 'and'
- fixed clearWithColor method
- Special thanks to 
  - Shilo White for the Pivot Point
  - Ludometrics for Bitmap Font kerning
  - Tadas Vilkeliskis for tweening of unsigned integers
  - Jonathan Shieh for his fix that allows unit tests to load files
  - Andreas WÃ¥lm for making generate_atlas.rb work with ruby 1.9
  - numerous forum members for bug reports, suggestions and feedback!
