--- hiero2sparrow.rb ---

This Ruby script converts Bitmap Font files created with the "Hiero"-Tool:
-> http://slick.cokeandcode.com/
to an XML format. That's the format Sparrow expects for its Bitmap Fonts.

As an alternative, you can use the Bitmap Font Generator from AngelCode:
-> http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/
It can export this xml format directly. However, this tool works only in MS Windows.

On OS X, Glyph Designer from 71Squared is a great font tool (it's not free, though):
-> http://glyphdesigner.71squared.com/
It exports to both the Hiero format and to Sparrow's native format. In the latter case, 
you can use its output without this script.

Usage: hiero2sparrow.rb input.fnt [output.fnt]

- The output parameter is optional. If omitted, the xml data overwrites the input file.

A tip when you use Hiero: 
Add at least 1 pixel padding to the "up" and "left" directions!
